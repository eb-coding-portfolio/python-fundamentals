**min/25/50/75th/max for all numeric variables**  
Observations --> -1 seems to be a min in a lot of the numerical columns, is this perhaps suppose to signify something else? Doesnt seem like a real value. Also some of the values seems unrealistically low, there is a value of 400 for a min median sales price which seems inaccurate.  

**for each categorical variable that isn't a unique identifier, get value counts**
